# Multiworld

This Minecraft plugin allows creating and accessing multiple worlds on a single Minecraft server instance.

This fork updates the original plugin to be compatible with recent Spigot releases. Supports 1.14 at the time of writing. World generators relying on pre-1.13 item IDs have been removed as maintaining them would have required a significant time investment.
